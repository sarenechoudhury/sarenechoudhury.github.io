### Work Experience

#### Quantbot Technologies, Quant Research Intern, Summer 2024

- Built ML models using Keras, Tensorflow, and LightGBM.
  
- Tested company and built-in functions to upgrade from Python 3.9 to 3.11.
  
- Researched and tested benefits of quantized gradients in LightGBM models.
  
- Created DeepChecks API suites for automated model and data evaluations in an online setting, configurable script sent success message or list of failed checks to company slack.
  
- Explored feature generation using OptionsTAQ data for equity-returns prediction, as well as intraday data for determining the sway of the top 10 companies per sector's performance on the rest of the corresponding sectors.
  
- Experimented with neural network implementation concerning layer types, normalization, quantization, early stopping, augmented boosting, and combination with LightGBM models.

#### Breakwater Yacht Club, Sailing Instructor, Summer 2021 & 2022

[Essay about this experience]('/files/commandments') 

#### SSAT and Math Tutor, 2021-2022

- Middle School level student.

- Created math homework sheets based on topics that student was studying in class at a more advanced level, as well as topics to be covered in the student's next year of schooling.

- Met on zoom to go over homework problems, and either worked through problems that the student had struggled with in the homework, or introduced a new topic if the student was comfortable with previously covered material

- Found tests for the SSAT from previous years and assigned portions of it for homework, and made homework sheets for topics the student struggled with

- Met on zoom to grade the SSAT test portions, go over problems that were missed by the student, and instruct the student on any topics they didn't know and go through new practice sheets together
