title: Vincerò!
---

For the sake of a perilous search, battling the waking hour of the sun each subject–

          Poor peasants!
 
Persevere through the witching hours, fraught tension threading around each limb, strangling! with the newest shriek of–

          Nessun Dorma.

A most curious sound accompanying, what is that? A Splash? A Drizzle? An unexplored crevice of the Watery domain calls and–A Drip! 

Burdensome curiosity weighs more than the terror, sinking beneath the realization that–is that? It cannot be! A Drip! 

Bliss of ignorance tickles mental fronds as a pause erupts out of a lone voice calling, centered around that most peculiar Drip.



          So confident,
 
He who–gallantly? No–foolishly requested the fourth duel with the Grim Reaper.

          So reckless.
 

Yet the Drip, where from does it hail? The iciest depths would fail to replicate the steam arising ‘bout an evident thaw.


          So witless,
 
He whose–beautiful? No–senseless voice crescendos to waltz with her wails.

          So pointless.  


Flailing limbs amass under her balcony of address as the gleam of nighttime jewels fade in favor of the aureate glow which–how? A sight unseen! 

A millennia of frosty argent replaced with a blaze under the canary fuschia amalgam of the heavens, do they open their arms for him? Casting down

their approval by setting her palace afire?

The final wisps of night flee as marked by a christening end to his ballad–

          Vincerò!
 
As the Drip transforms, a Flood emerges from the layers of crackling ice surrounding–her heart! Every Drip matched each word of his melody–she

melts for him!

Oh, cold princess Turandot. He who vanquished your trials, He who took another step to lay rest your outrage, He who is named–Calaf!

          Ha vinto.
